# React Lift

React Lift is a dynamic web application designed to simulate a lift (elevator) system. This project leverages the power of React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS to create an interactive and visually appealing simulation. The application is ideal for demonstrating React state management, animations, and responsive design.
